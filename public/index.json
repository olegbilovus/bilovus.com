[{"categories":["Security","Wearables","Android"],"collections":null,"content":"In emergency situations, access to important data such as digital IDs, passwords, 2FA codes, and emergency contacts may be critical. While smartphones typically store this information, they may not always be accessible. Smartwatches, particularly those running Wear OS, offer an alternative storage option that remains physically accessible. While encrypted cloud backups provide data redundancy, a local copy stored on a wearable device can offer immediate access during emergencies. Combining steganography with encryption provides a secure method for storing data on Wear OS devices. This approach embeds encrypted data within an audio file, which can then be stored on the smartwatch. Wear OS does not provide direct file system access through a native \u0026ldquo;Files\u0026rdquo; app like Android phones. However, ADB (Android Debug Bridge) can be used to transfer files to and from the smartwatch. Periodic updates to the stored data can be accomplished directly from an Android phone without requiring a computer. This can be achieved using two apps: Termux: A terminal emulator for Android that enables the use of steganography and encryption tools directly on the phone. ADB Shell - Debug Toolbox: An app that facilitates file transfers between the phone and smartwatch using ADB commands through a graphical user interface. Some features may require the pro version. At the end of this guide, in Security Considerations, there are important points to consider regarding the security of this method.

Wireless debugging (ADB over Wi-Fi) is enabled on the smartwatch. The smartwatch and the phone are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Using the ADB Shell - Debug Toolbox app, the first step is to connect to the smartwatch. The process is similar to connecting ADB over Wi-Fi from a computer. If a local VPN for DNS filtering is active on the phone, it may need to be disabled temporarily to allow the connection. The connection may require several attempts to succeed. After a long period of inactivity (days), it may be necessary to unpair and re-pair the devices from the smartwatch and phone settings. If connection errors occur, verify that the Connection Port in the app matches the port shown on the smartwatch under Wireless Debugging. The port changes after each connection, so it may need to be updated in the app. When the connection is successful, you will see the smartwatch listed as a connected device in the app as shown below: ADB Connected to Smartwatch Once connected, scroll the upper toolbar horizontally to find the \u0026ldquo;Local files\u0026rdquo; option.

This approach enables capturing all traffic on the network, including ARP and other link-layer protocols. Tcpdump supports capturing traffic from specific devices by filtering based on MAC or IP addresses. Multiple devices support OpenWRT firmware, and some ship with OpenWRT pre-installed, such as GL.iNet routers. The primary limitation of this method is the storage space on the router, as capturing all traffic can quickly consume available space. Capture can be performed remotely via SSH, and GL.iNet routers support USB and/or SD card storage expansion. For extended capture sessions, implementing a system service that manages its lifecycle in case of failure is recommended. Below is an example of a service file saved as /etc/init.d/tcpdump_capture: #!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common USE_PROCD=1 START=99 PROG=/root/myservices/tcpdump.sh # Path to the traffic capture script start_service() { procd_open_instance procd_set_param command $PROG procd_set_param respawn # Automatically restart service if it crashes procd_set_param stdout 1 # Redirect standard output to system log procd_set_param stderr 1 # Redirect standard error to system log procd_close_instance } To enable the service, run the following commands on the router: chmod +x /etc/init.d/tcpdump_capture service tcpdump_capture enable # Enable the service to start on boot service tcpdump_capture start The script /root/myservices/tcpdump.sh could be something like this: #!/bin/sh set -e # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status now=`date +\u0026#34;%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%S\u0026#34;` # Saves to external SD card in pcap directory out=\u0026#34;/tmp/mountd/disk1_part1/pcap/capture-$now.pcap\u0026#34; echo $out /usr/sbin/tcpdump -i wlan0 -n -w $out host 192.168.0.10 or ether host xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx This script captures all traffic from a specific device on the network, based on its IP or MAC address, and saves it to an external SD card in pcap format. For real-time traffic viewing, the latest captured pcap file can be piped to Wireshark running on a remote machine: eval $(ssh-agent -s) # Start the SSH agent ssh-add .ssh/gl_axt1800 # Add the private key for authentication # SSH into the router, tail the latest pcap file, and pipe it to Wireshark ssh -i .ssh/gl_axt1800 root@192.168.8.1 \u0026#34;tail -n +1 -f /tmp/mountd/disk1_part1/pcap/\\$(ls -t /tmp/mountd/disk1_part1/pcap/ | head -n 1)\u0026#34; | wireshark -k -i - These commands establish an SSH session to the router, tail the latest pcap file, and pipe it to Wireshark running on the local machine for real-time viewing. Using ssh-agent avoids entering the password multiple times. Without the agent, the last command requires password entry.
